*Dataset*

(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

*Files*

**CodeBook.md** a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

**run_analysis.R** performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:

- [x] Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- [x] Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- [x] Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- [x] Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- [x] From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
